### 4. What is RDBMS? Properties.
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of DBMS that stores data in tables (relations). The data in RDBMS is structured in rows and columns.

*Properties of RDBMS:*
- *Data Integrity:* Ensures the accuracy and consistency of data.
- *Data Security:* Manages user permissions to control access to data.
- *Atomicity:* Ensures operations are fully completed or not executed at all.
- *Consistency:* Ensures data is accurate and consistent after transactions.
- *Isolation:* Ensures operations are isolated from each other.
- *Durability:* Ensures that completed transactions are saved permanently.

*Real-Life Example:*  
Popular RDBMS examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. These are used by banks to manage customer data, transactions, and accounts.

### 5. Types of Database Languages
- *Data Definition Language (DDL):* Defines database structures, such as creating tables and altering schemas.
- *Data Manipulation Language (DML):* Handles data retrieval and manipulation, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- *Data Control Language (DCL):* Manages access controls (GRANT, REVOKE).
- *Transaction Control Language (TCL):* Manages transaction operations (COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

---

### 6. ACID Properties
ACID is a set of properties that ensure reliable transaction processing in a DBMS.

1. *Atomicity:* Transactions are either fully completed or not executed at all.
2. *Consistency:* Ensures that the database transitions from one consistent state to another.
3. *Isolation:* Ensures that operations of one transaction do not affect others.
4. *Durability:* Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its results are permanent, even in case of a system crash.

*Real-Life Example:*  
In banking, when transferring money from one account to another, ACID properties ensure that the transaction is complete, accurate, and unaffected by any system failures.

### 7. Difference Between Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
- *Vertical Scaling:* Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single server to handle increased load.
- *Horizontal Scaling:* Adding more servers to distribute the load across multiple machines.

*Real-Life Example:*
- *Vertical Scaling:* Upgrading a server for a high-traffic website.
- *Horizontal Scaling:* Adding more servers to handle global traffic for an e-commerce platform.

---

### 8. What is Sharding?
Sharding is the process of breaking a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called "shards." Each shard is stored on a separate server or instance, and they work together to form the complete dataset.

*Real-Life Example:*  
A social media platform like Facebook or Twitter might shard user data across multiple servers based on location or user ID ranges to distribute the load efficiently.

*Pros:*
- Improved performance and scalability.
- Data can be distributed across different geographical locations for redundancy.

*Cons:*
- Increased complexity in data management.
- Difficulties in maintaining consistency across shards.

### 9. Keys in DBMS
Keys in DBMS are attributes or a set of attributes that uniquely identify records in a table.

1. *Primary Key:* Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
2. *Foreign Key:* A key used to link two tables together.
3. *Candidate Key:* Any key that can uniquely identify a record in a table.
4. *Composite Key:* A key that consists of two or more attributes to uniquely identify a record.
5. *Unique Key:* Similar to primary key but can have NULL values.

*Real-Life Example:*  
In a university database, a Student ID can be a primary key, and a Course ID can be a foreign key in a table representing enrollments.

---

### 10. Types of Relationships
1. *One-to-One (1:1):* A single record in one table is related to a single record in another table.
2. *One-to-Many (1:N):* A single record in one table is related to multiple records in another table.
3. *Many-to-Many (M:N):* Multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table.

*Real-Life Example:*
- *One-to-One:* A person has only one passport.
- *One-to-Many:* A department has many employees.
- *Many-to-Many:* Students enroll in many courses, and courses have many students.

### 11. Data Abstraction in DBMS, Three Levels of it
Data abstraction in DBMS involves hiding the complexity of the database and providing a simplified view to the users. It is done at three levels:
1. *Physical Level:* Describes how data is stored (e.g., files, indexes).
2. *Logical Level:* Describes what data is stored and the relationships between them.
3. *View Level:* Describes how data is presented to users (e.g., reports, forms).

*Real-Life Example:*  
A bank employee interacting with a database might only see customer account information (view level), while the actual data might be stored in complex ways (physical level).

---

### 12. Indexing in DBMS
Indexing in DBMS is a technique used to speed up data retrieval operations by creating a data structure (typically a B-tree or Hash Index) that improves the search performance.

*Pros:*
- Faster query response times for searches and retrievals.
- Optimized for large datasets.

*Cons:*
- Additional storage space required for indexes.
- Slower performance for write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to index maintenance.

*Real-Life Example:*  
Search engines like Google use indexing to quickly retrieve search results from massive datasets.

### 13. What is DDL (Data Definition Language)?
DDL is a subset of SQL that deals with defining the structure of a database. It includes commands like:
- *CREATE:* To create new tables or databases.
- *ALTER:* To modify the structure of an existing database.
- *DROP:* To delete a table or database.

*Real-Life Example:*  
Creating a new table in an HR management system to store employee information.

---

### 14. What is DML (Data Manipulation Language)?
DML is a subset of SQL used to manipulate data in the database. It includes commands like:
- *SELECT:* Retrieve data.
- *INSERT:* Insert new data into a table.
- *UPDATE:* Modify existing data.
- *DELETE:* Remove data from a table.

*Real-Life Example:*  
In an online shopping system, an admin might use INSERT to add new product data or UPDATE to change the price of a product.

---

### 15. What is Normalization? Types of Normalization.
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables. It aims to achieve data integrity and efficiency.

*Types of Normalization:*
1. *First Normal Form (1NF):* Ensures that there are no repeating groups or arrays.
2. *Second Normal Form (2NF):* Eliminates partial dependency.
3. *Third Normal Form (3NF):* Eliminates transitive dependency.
4. *Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):* A stricter version of 3NF.

*Real-Life Example:*  
A customer order system might be normalized to separate customer details and order details into different tables to avoid redundancy.

---

### 16. What is Denormalization?
Denormalization is the process of combining tables to reduce the number of joins required for queries, usually for performance reasons. It increases redundancy but can improve read performance.

*Pros:*
- Faster query performance for read-heavy applications.

*Cons:*
- Increased storage requirements.
- Greater risk of data anomalies.

*Real-Life Example:*  
A reporting system might denormalize data to generate quick reports, despite some data redundancy.
