### 2. What is a Database?
A database is a collection of organized data that can be accessed, managed, and updated efficiently. It can store various types of data such as text, numbers, and binary data.

*Real-Life Example:*  
A library's database stores information about books, borrowers, and transaction logs.

---

### 3. What is a Database System?
A Database System refers to the combination of DBMS software and the database itself. It includes the database structure, the management system, and the applications interacting with the data.

*Real-Life Example:*  
An e-commerce website uses a database system to manage customer information, product inventory, and orders.

---

### 4. What is RDBMS? Properties.
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of DBMS that stores data in tables (relations). The data in RDBMS is structured in rows and columns.

*Properties of RDBMS:*
- *Data Integrity:* Ensures the accuracy and consistency of data.
- *Data Security:* Manages user permissions to control access to data.
- *Atomicity:* Ensures operations are fully completed or not executed at all.
- *Consistency:* Ensures data is accurate and consistent after transactions.
- *Isolation:* Ensures operations are isolated from each other.
- *Durability:* Ensures that completed transactions are saved permanently.

*Real-Life Example:*  
Popular RDBMS examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. These are used by banks to manage customer data, transactions, and accounts.

---

### 5. Types of Database Languages
- *Data Definition Language (DDL):* Defines database structures, such as creating tables and altering schemas.
- *Data Manipulation Language (DML):* Handles data retrieval and manipulation, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- *Data Control Language (DCL):* Manages access controls (GRANT, REVOKE).
- *Transaction Control Language (TCL):* Manages transaction operations (COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

---

### 6. ACID Properties
ACID is a set of properties that ensure reliable transaction processing in a DBMS.

1. *Atomicity:* Transactions are either fully completed or not executed at all.
2. *Consistency:* Ensures that the database transitions from one consistent state to another.
3. *Isolation:* Ensures that operations of one transaction do not affect others.
4. *Durability:* Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its results are permanent, even in case of a system crash.

*Real-Life Example:*  
In banking, when transferring money from one account to another, ACID properties ensure that the transaction is complete, accurate, and unaffected by any system failures.

---

### 7. Difference Between Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
- *Vertical Scaling:* Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single server to handle increased load.
- *Horizontal Scaling:* Adding more servers to distribute the load across multiple machines.

*Real-Life Example:*
- *Vertical Scaling:* Upgrading a server for a high-traffic website.
- *Horizontal Scaling:* Adding more servers to handle global traffic for an e-commerce platform.

---

### 8. What is Sharding?
Sharding is the process of breaking a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called "shards." Each shard is stored on a separate server or instance, and they work together to form the complete dataset.

*Real-Life Example:*  
A social media platform like Facebook or Twitter might shard user data across multiple servers based on location or user ID ranges to distribute the load efficiently.

*Pros:*
- Improved performance and scalability.
- Data can be distributed across different geographical locations for redundancy.

*Cons:*
- Increased complexity in data management.
- Difficulties in maintaining consistency across shards.

---

### 9. Keys in DBMS
Keys in DBMS are attributes or a set of attributes that uniquely identify records in a table.

1. *Primary Key:* Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
2. *Foreign Key:* A key used to link two tables together.
3. *Candidate Key:* Any key that can uniquely identify a record in a table.
4. *Composite Key:* A key that consists of two or more attributes to uniquely identify a record.
5. *Unique Key:* Similar to primary key but can have NULL values.

*Real-Life Example:*  
In a university database, a Student ID can be a primary key, and a Course ID can be a foreign key in a table representing enrollments.

---

### 10. Types of Relationships
1. *One-to-One (1:1):* A single record in one table is related to a single record in another table.
2. *One-to-Many (1:N):* A single record in one table is related to multiple records in another table.
3. *Many-to-Many (M:N):* Multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table.

*Real-Life Example:*
- *One-to-One:* A person has only one passport.
- *One-to-Many:* A department has many employees.
- *Many-to-Many:* Students enroll in many courses, and courses have many students.

---

### 11. Data Abstraction in DBMS, Three Levels of it
Data abstraction in DBMS involves hiding the complexity of the database and providing a simplified view to the users. It is done at three levels:
1. *Physical Level:* Describes how data is stored (e.g., files, indexes).
2. *Logical Level:* Describes what data is stored and the relationships between them.
3. *View Level:* Describes how data is presented to users (e.g., reports, forms).

*Real-Life Example:*  
A bank employee interacting with a database might only see customer account information (view level), while the actual data might be stored in complex ways (physical level).

---

### 12. Indexing in DBMS
Indexing in DBMS is a technique used to speed up data retrieval operations by creating a data structure (typically a B-tree or Hash Index) that improves the search performance.

*Pros:*
- Faster query response times for searches and retrievals.
- Optimized for large datasets.

*Cons:*
- Additional storage space required for indexes.
- Slower performance for write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to index maintenance.

*Real-Life Example:*  
Search engines like Google use indexing to quickly retrieve search results from massive datasets.

---

### 13. What is DDL (Data Definition Language)?
DDL is a subset of SQL that deals with defining the structure of a database. It includes commands like:
- *CREATE:* To create new tables or databases.
- *ALTER:* To modify the structure of an existing database.
- *DROP:* To delete a table or database.

*Real-Life Example:*  
Creating a new table in an HR management system to store employee information.

---

### 14. What is DML (Data Manipulation Language)?
DML is a subset of SQL used to manipulate data in the database. It includes commands like:
- *SELECT:* Retrieve data.
- *INSERT:* Insert new data into a table.
- *UPDATE:* Modify existing data.
- *DELETE:* Remove data from a table.

*Real-Life Example:*  
In an online shopping system, an admin might use INSERT to add new product data or UPDATE to change the price of a product.

---

### 15. What is Normalization? Types of Normalization.
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables. It aims to achieve data integrity and efficiency.

*Types of Normalization:*
1. *First Normal Form (1NF):* Ensures that there are no repeating groups or arrays.
2. *Second Normal Form (2NF):* Eliminates partial dependency.
3. *Third Normal Form (3NF):* Eliminates transitive dependency.
4. *Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):* A stricter version of 3NF.

*Real-Life Example:*  
A customer order system might be normalized to separate customer details and order details into different tables to avoid redundancy.

---

### 16. What is Denormalization?
Denormalization is the process of combining tables to reduce the number of joins required for queries, usually for performance reasons. It increases redundancy but can improve read performance.

*Pros:*
- Faster query performance for read-heavy applications.

*Cons:*
- Increased storage requirements.
- Greater risk of data anomalies.

*Real-Life Example:*  
A reporting system might denormalize data to generate quick reports, despite some data redundancy.

---

## 17. What is Functional Dependency?
Functional Dependency (FD) is a relationship between two attributes in a database, where one attribute uniquely determines the value of another attribute. In simpler terms, if you know the value of one attribute, you can determine the value of another.

### Example:
In a university database, the Student ID determines the Student Name, so thereâ€™s a functional dependency between Student ID and Student Name.

### Real-Life Example:
If you know a product's Product ID, you can always determine its Product Name.

---

## 18. E-R Model
The Entity-Relationship (E-R) model is a diagrammatic representation of entities (objects) and their relationships. It helps in database design by illustrating how different entities interact.

### Components:
- **Entities:** Objects with distinct existence (e.g., Student, Teacher).
- **Attributes:** Properties or characteristics of entities (e.g., Student Name, Teacher ID).
- **Relationships:** Connections between entities (e.g., Student enrolls in Course).

### Real-Life Example:
In a school database, an Entity could be Student, an Attribute could be Student Name, and a Relationship could be Enrolled (Student -> Course).

---

## 19. Conflict Serializability in DBMS
Conflict serializability refers to the concept of ensuring the correctness of database transactions in a concurrent environment. If the results of a transaction schedule can be transformed into a serial schedule (where transactions are executed one after another) by swapping non-conflicting operations, the schedule is said to be conflict-serializable.

### Real-Life Example:
In an online banking system, conflict serializability ensures that simultaneous transactions, like money transfers, do not lead to inconsistencies such as double-spending.

---

## 20. What is CCP (Concurrency Control Protocols)?
Concurrency Control Protocols are mechanisms used in database management systems to ensure that transactions are executed concurrently without violating the consistency of the database. These protocols prevent issues like data anomalies, deadlocks, and lost updates.

### Types of CCP:
- **Lock-based Protocols:** Use locks to control access to data (e.g., read and write locks).
- **Timestamp-based Protocols:** Assign timestamps to transactions to order their execution.
- **Optimistic Protocols:** Transactions execute without restrictions and are validated at the end.

### Real-Life Example:
In an online auction system, CCP ensures that multiple users can place bids without interfering with each otherâ€™s bids.

---

## 21. Entity, Entity Type, Entity Set, Weak Entity Set

- **Entity:** An object or thing in the real world with a distinct existence, such as a person, product, or company.
- **Entity Type:** A collection of entities that share the same properties (e.g., all students in a university).
- **Entity Set:** A set of entities of the same type.
- **Weak Entity Set:** An entity set that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone and depends on a strong entity set for identification.

### Real-Life Example:
- **Entity:** A student.
- **Entity Type:** All students in a university.
- **Entity Set:** A collection of all students enrolled in a particular course.
- **Weak Entity Set:** A dependent course module that needs to be identified by a combination of course ID and department.

---

## 22. What are SQL Commands? Types of Them
SQL commands are used to interact with a database. They are classified into various categories:

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Defines the structure of the database (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Manipulates the data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Controls access to data (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Manages transactions (e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

---

## 23. Nested Queries in SQL
A nested query is a query inside another query. The inner query provides input to the outer query, allowing for more complex operations.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM department WHERE name = 'HR');
```

### Real-Life Example:
Nested queries can be used to find students who have completed a specific set of courses in a school database.

---

## 24. What is JOIN? Explain Types of JOINs
JOIN is an SQL operation used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.

- **INNER JOIN:** Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):** Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

### Real-Life Example:
An employee table can be joined with a department table to show employees and their corresponding department names.

---

## 25. Difference Between 2-Tier and 3-Tier Architecture

- **2-Tier Architecture:** Involves two layers â€“ client and server. The client interacts directly with the database server.
- **3-Tier Architecture:** Involves three layers â€“ client, application server, and database server. The application server acts as an intermediary to process business logic.

### Real-Life Example:
- **2-Tier:** A desktop application connected directly to a local database.
- **3-Tier:** A web application where the user interface interacts with an application server, which in turn interacts with the database.

---

## 26. Difference Between TRUNCATE and DELETE Command

- **TRUNCATE:** Removes all rows from a table, but does not log individual row deletions and cannot be rolled back. It resets the table structure.
- **DELETE:** Removes rows one at a time and logs each row deletion. It can be rolled back and allows conditions to specify which rows to delete.

### Real-Life Example:
- **TRUNCATE:** Used when removing all records from a log table.
- **DELETE:** Used when removing specific entries like deleting inactive user accounts.

---

## 27. Difference Between Intension and Extension in a Database

- **Intension:** The structure or schema of a database (e.g., table structure, column definitions).
- **Extension:** The data or the actual content in the database at any given time.

### Real-Life Example:
- **Intension:** The schema of a "Users" table.
- **Extension:** The actual data records of users in that table at a given point in time.

---

## 28. Difference Between Shared Lock and Exclusive Lock, Definition of Lock

- **Shared Lock:** Allows multiple transactions to read data but not modify it. Other transactions can also acquire shared locks on the same data.
- **Exclusive Lock:** Allows a transaction to read and modify data, and prevents other transactions from acquiring any kind of lock on the same data.

### Real-Life Example:
- **Shared Lock:** Multiple users viewing a product on an e-commerce platform.
- **Exclusive Lock:** A single user purchasing the product.
